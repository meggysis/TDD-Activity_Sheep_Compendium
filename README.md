## Features
- **Create a Sheep:** Add new sheep to the database.
- **Read Sheep:** Retrieve data for individual sheep or all sheep in the database.

- **Delete Sheep:** Remove sheep from the database.

## Technologies Used
- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- Pydantic: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- pytest: A framework for testing your code and ensuring functionality.
